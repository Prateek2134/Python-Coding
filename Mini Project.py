Good morning Mam/Sir, I'm Prateek. I graduated from CMR Engineering College. I did my 12th at Vignan College in Telangana. Before that, I completed my 10th at MGM School in Chattisgarh. My mom is a pathologist and my dad runs a clothes business.

I studied B.Tech in AIML, where I learned Python and other coding languages. I have two years of experience in machine learning algorithms. During college, I completed two projects. One was a major project, and the other was for the SIH competition. For the SIH project, my team and I built a website for people who are deaf, dumb, and blind. The website helps them learn quickly by offering features like audio recognition and sign language interpretation. The other project focused on detecting plant diseases and recommending pesticides. We used a CNN model to accurately detect diseases and suggest suitable pesticides.

I also earned certificates for participating in both internal and external SIH competitions. Additionally, I completed a virtual internship in Cognizant and AICTE in the AIML field. These experiences significantly enhanced my knowledge in machine learning.

My hobbies include playing games, watching funny videos, and listening to music. One of my strengths is that my weakness actually serves as my strength. When faced with challenges, I turn my weaknesses into motivation, maintaining a positive mindset to tackle tasks. However, I sometimes get nervous over small matters. Despite this, I strive to overcome my nerves and focus on the task at hand.
